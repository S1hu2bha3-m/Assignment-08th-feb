    "Ans. Abstraction in OOPs refers to the process of hiding the complexity of the implementation of a program from the user, and only exposing the necessary and relevant functionalities to them. In simple terms, it is a way of simplifying the user's interaction with the program.\n",

    "Ans. Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and complexity from the user and only exposing the relevant functionalities. It is achieved by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define the methods and attributes that are necessary for the user to interact with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing the necessary functionalities through public methods. It is achieved by creating classes that have private data members and public methods that access or modify those data members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a class called BankAccount in Python that represents a bank account object. The class can have attributes such as account number, account holder name, balance, and methods such as deposit(), withdraw(), and get_balance().\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement abstraction, we can create an abstract class called Account that defines the basic methods such as deposit(), withdraw(), and get_balance(). The BankAccount class can then inherit from this abstract class and implement its own version of these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement encapsulation, we can make the balance attribute private in the BankAccount class and provide public methods such as deposit() and withdraw() that modify the balance attribute. This way, the user cannot directly access or modify the balance attribute, and can only interact with it through the public methods provided by the class."
